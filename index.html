            <h1>Bayern Munich: Branko Zebec, the brilliant, damaged manager who helped shape a giant</h1>
            <h3>Branko Zebec deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest coaches of his era, and yet his name is largely</h3>
            <p>
                He significantly influenced the careers of numerous superstars, and Paul Breitner - one of only four players in history to have scored in two World Cup finals - describes him as the best coach he worked with.<br>
                Zebec was a tough and complex person who referred to himself as a dictator, yet struggled to cope with his own issues. He was ridiculed for falling asleep on the bench during matches and would appear drunk at news conferences, often making bizarre statements.<br>
                His tactical genius was extraordinary, his unique story tragic in the extreme. Zebec led Bayern Munich to their maiden Bundesliga title in 1969 and repeated the feat against all odds with Hamburg 10 years later.<br>

                His contribution to establishing Bayern as a major force in European football cannot be overstated, but his career - and indeed his life - ended prematurely because of desperate alcohol addiction.

            <h1>Gareth Bale: Real Madrid forward 'didn't want to play' against Manchester City - Zidane</h1>
            <h3>Gareth Bale "didn't want to play" in the Champions League last-16 second-leg tie against Manchester City, says Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane.</h3>
            <p>
                Wales forward Bale has been left out of Real's 24-man squad for Friday's match.
                The 31-year-old only started 14 games in all competitions in 2019-20 and has played just twice since football in Spain restarted in June.
                "It was a personal conversation I had with him. He preferred not to play," said Zidane.
                "The rest remains between me and him but he said he didn't want to play."
                BBC Sport understands Bale decided not to travel to Manchester because he knew he had no chance of being involved in the match.
                City won 2-1 in the first leg in Spain in February before the coronavirus pandemic caused the competition to be halted for almost five months.
                The winners of the tie will play either Lyon or Juventus in the quarter-finals.
                Bale - who was set to move to Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning last summer before the deal fell through -
                has looked indifferent in recent weeks, including pretending to be asleep as a substitute as Real went on a 10-game winning run to become Spanish champions.

            <p>Who are the clubs well placed to progress from the Champions League last 16? And who has it all to do?
                Football's suspension because of coronavirus meant the competition was halted with four last-16 ties completed and four still to be concluded.
                RB Leipzig knocked out Tottenham Hotspur, Atletico Madrid edged past Liverpool, Atalanta eliminated Valencia and Paris St-Germain fought back to see off Borussia Dortmund.

            <p>The Champions League is back - so it's time for a test for you.
                Can you name every side to reach the quarter-finals since 1994-95?
                The teams are listed in the order they first appeared in the last eight from that season - the first year the new competition had a quarter-final.
                Oh, and with four last-16 ties still to be completed, it doesn't include the 2020 line up, so RB Leipzig and Atalanta are not on the list.
